# Global terrorism project notes:
* I have split the data into three csv files since GitHub desktop uploading file limit is only 100MB and my data's size was 162MB. So, in order to upload the data I have split the file into data_1.csv, data_2.csv and data_3.csv and combined them into a single dataframe on jupyter notebook. 
* Folium Map is not being displayed on GitHub, so I have uploaded the pictures of my interactive map on GitHub repository with the file name Folium-map1.png and Folium-map2.png. Folium-map2.png is just a zoomed in version of Folium-map1.png. You can either see these two files or run my code to get the interactive plot.
* I have also streamed live tweets on terrorism. The codes for that are on jupyter notebook and  authenticate.py,myMap.py,private.py,settings.py files.
